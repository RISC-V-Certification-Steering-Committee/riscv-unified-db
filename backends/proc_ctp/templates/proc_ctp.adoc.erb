=== What's a CTP?

Certification Test Plans (CTPs) list certification coverage points and how they will be tested via
certification test procedures (step by step descriptions of tests).
CTPs are developed by the RVI CSC (Certification Steering Committee) organization in collaboration
with the RVI TSC (Technical Steering Committee) organization who creates RISC-V standards including
the RISC-V Unprivileged and Privileged ISA manuals.

Each certificate has a corresponding CRD and CTP:

* The CRD defines the certification requirements an implementation must meet to obtain certification.
* The CTP defines the certification coverage points and certification test procedures followed by the certification
  tests that an implementation must pass to obtain certification.

A CTP is structured into 3 volumes as follows:

* Volume A is the core CTP documentation including an appendix each for extension, instruction, and CSR
  that could be present in a certificate.
* Volume B is the RISC-V Unprivileged ISA manual (uses release specified by the certificate)
* Volume C is the RISC-V Privileged ISA manual (uses release specified by the certificate)

The certification coverage points reference text in any or all of the following:

* RISC-V ISA manuals in volumes B and C
* Community-generated documentation located in volume A (https://github.com/riscv-software-src/riscv-unified-db)
* IDL (ISA Description Language) executable psuedo-code descriptions located in volume A

The RISC-V ISA manuals in Volumes B and C are the preferred reference for certification coverage points since these manuals
represent the ratified RISC-V standards from the TSC.
However, if the information in the ISA manuals isn't sufficiently clear or complete for certification purposes
the content in Volume A is used to fill that gap.

=== Naming Scheme

==== CTP Naming

<%= proc_cert_design.include_erb("rvcp_naming_scheme.adoc.erb") %>

The specific rules for updating the version number for a CTP are as follows:

* The <major> release number is updated for changes that *could* cause a previously certified
   implementation to now fail. An example is increasing coverage.
* The <minor> release number is updated when the CRD referenced by a CTP adds support for new optional behaviors.
* The <patch> release number is updated for documentation fixes/improvements.
  These changes *cannot* cause a previously certified implementation to no longer pass certification.
