introduction: |
  The AC200 Processor Certificate targets RISC-V Apps Processors targeting embedded applications
  running a custom Yocto Linux distribution. Software source code compatibility is a strong requirement
  and binary compatibility is a lesser requirement.

  AC200 is based on the following:

  * RVA23 Profile (includes mandantory Hypervisor and Vector support)
  * M-mode requirements
  * AIA or PLIC interrupt controller
  * Debug and trace (TBD)

# XXX - Remove version information since specifying priv/unpriv ISA manual should imply this.
