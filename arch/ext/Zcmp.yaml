long_name: Combination compressed instructions
description: |
  The Zcmp extension is a set of instructions which may be executed as a series of existing 32-bit
  RISC-V instructions.

  This extension reuses some encodings from c.fsdsp. Therefore it is incompatible with `Zcd`, which is
  included when `C` and `D` extensions are both present.

  NOTE
  Zcmp is primarily targeted at embedded class CPUs due to implementation
  complexity. Additionally, it is not compatible with architecture class profiles.

  The `Zcmp` extension depends on the `Zca` extension.

  The PUSH/POP assembly syntax uses several variables, the meaning of which are:

  * reg_list is a list containing 1 to 13 registers (ra and 0 to 12 s registers)
  * valid values: {ra}, {ra, s0}, {ra, s0-s1}, {ra, s0-s2}, …, {ra, s0-s8}, {ra, s0-s9}, {ra, s0-s11}
  * note that {ra, s0-s10} is not valid, giving 12 lists not 13 for better encoding
  * stack_adj is the total size of the stack frame.
  * valid values vary with register list length and the specific encoding, see the instruction
    pages for details.
